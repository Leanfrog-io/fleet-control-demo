# Fleet Control Demo

## Description

This project is a demonstration of competence in frontend development using React, Redux Toolkit, and Three.js. The application showcases a fleet of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) displayed on a 2D map. It allows users to start and stop the entire fleet or control individual AGVs. Each AGV has a battery level, which drains when the AGV is moving. When the battery level reaches 0%, the AGV stops moving.

This application uses Three.js for 2D map representation, React and Redux for managing state, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Installation and Running the App

The application is created using create-react-app and uses the following main dependencies:

- React
- Redux Toolkit
- Three.js
- @react-three/fiber
- @react-three/drei
- Tailwind CSS

To install and run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. After the installation is complete, run `npm start` to start the application.

These commands will start the development server, and the application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

The application is intended for demo purposes only. It showcases the use of Three.js for 2D graphics in a React application and Redux for state management.

Enjoy the demo!
